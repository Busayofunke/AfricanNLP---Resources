## FastText Embeddings for African languages
We provide better quality word embeddings than the [pre-trained FastText embeddings](https://fasttext.cc/docs/en/crawl-vectors.html) trained on Common crawl and Wikipedia. While we did not evaluate the quality on all the languages, our evaluation on Yoruba and Twi shows that they give better performance on word similarity tasks. The new word embeddings are trained on curated data from JW300, Bible, VOA, BBC, and other news websites. Details of the data sources are in my PhD dissertation. All embedding models can be downloaded from Zenodo. Please, find the links below.
